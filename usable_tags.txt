File formats to consider supporting:
    JPEG2000 / JXL (Need example to test on)
    PPM (Need example to test on)
    PSD (Need example to test on)
    TIFF (Need example to test on)
TESTED via Tests/battery.sh based on common XMP metadata fields below:
    OK:
        GIF (29/29)
        JPEG / JPG (29/29)
        PNG (29/29)
        M4A (29/29)
        MP4 (29/29)
        PDF (28/29, drops support for Comment)
        WEBP (28/29, drops support for Comment)
    MORE TESTING NEEDED:
        AVIF (Reads as JPEG or GIF and refuses to treat them otherwise LOL)
    KNOWN NOT SUPPORTED:
        AIFF (ExifTool does not support writing yet)
        MP3 (ExifTool does not support writing yet)
        OGG (ExifTool does not support writing yet)
        WAV (ExifTool does not support writing yet)
        WEBM (ExifTool does not support writing yet)

Metadata Field Formats:
    date: YYYY:mm:dd HH:MM:SS[.ss][+/-HH:MM]
    lang-alt: Tag supports alternate langauges ({tag}-fr, {tag}-en_US, for example)
    boolean: [{Yes}{No}]
Structs have to be specified by flattened components (or fully qualified).
You may need to pass `-struct` to ExifTool in order to read the tag back.

+ indicates a List tag that can be appended to
/ indicates a tag ExifTool will edit, but preferably avoid creating if another same-name tag can be created instead
! indicates a tag that is generally unsafe to write to under normal circumstances as they can affect data processing / rendering
* indicates protected tag which is handled automatically by ExifTool
: indicates a mandatory tag which may be added automatically when writing
